<h1 style="color:#8b0000">Virtual Learning Factory</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The physical Learning Factory 4.0 is located in the production planning lab of the University of Applied Sciences Emden/Leer and demonstrates a shop floor production consisting of a high-bay warehouse, machining centers with conveyor belts, and robots with pneumatic and electric grippers and optical quality control. The learning factory aims to represent an Industry 4.0 conform production system to teach how an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system can digitally be connected with a production system to produce different products. Moreover, it is presented how different production data (e.g., status information, processing time, energy demand) can be used for simulation-based production planning and controlling processes according to sustainability aspects. Production data are offered to digital services with the help of measuring devices and digital interfaces. Production data are offered to digital services with the help of measuring devices and digital interfaces.</p>

<p>The transparency of the system (from process level to management level) is made possible by communication between the individual elements of the system (e.g., the Fischertechnik modules and the various information management systems). Each Fischertechnik module is equipped with a TXT controller, which does not support an interface for direct communication with a database (e.g., Oracle database of the ERP system). Therefore, all TXT controllers in the Fischertechnik production system are extended by one Raspberry Pi (mini-computer). This allows communication between the individual processing centers and the ERP system. </p>
<p>The individual machining centers are integrated into a service architecture, which is gradually extended within the project by sensors and measuring devices for data acquisition and services, such as simulations.</p>

<h2>Virtual Learning Factory 4.0 (How To)</h2>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis and affects humans regardless of nationality, level of education, income, and gender. The actions to control the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., lockdowns) have disturbed, for example, conventional schooling through school and university closures worldwide. In lockdown periods, students have to rely more on their own resources (e.g., computer, internet connection) to continue learning remotely. However, lecturers also have to adapt to these new teaching conditions. Common lecture and learning factory concepts have been transferred in online formats.</p>

</p>It was impossible to access the physical Learning Factory 4.0 remotely, and students were unable to interact with the system for their project works. Therefore, the physical Learning Factory 4.0 has been transferred to a virtual learning factory to enable online access for the students. The virtual learning factory represents a digital model of the physical learning factory without digital connections to the physical system. The digital model was created in AnyLogic® and is accessible through the AnyLogic® Cloud. The AnyLogic® Cloud is a secure web platform for running simulations. The platform provides easy access to private and public simulations, even if the user does not use the AnyLogic® software. The virtual learning factory provides similar functionalities and data as its physical twin. The data, e.g., processing times, energy demands, production failures, can be exported to EXCEL for further analysis. With the aid of action buttons or imported production schedules, the warehouse can be loaded with new material, which can then be released to the production system. Moreover, 3D models provided by fischertechnik are used to visualize the production system as realistic as possible.</p>
